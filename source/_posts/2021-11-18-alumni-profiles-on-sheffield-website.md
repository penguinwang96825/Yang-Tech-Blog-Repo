# Introduction

I have recently been asked by my supervisor, Prof Chenghua Lin, to add my alumni profile to University of Sheffield website. There are some questions that has been asked I found it interesting, and I want to share them here.

**What are your main responsibilities?**

As a research intern in VoiceBase Centre, I conduct experiment regarding to speech technology. To be more specific, I build the pipeline for training channel demixing network to  separate speech source. Fulfill tasks set out by supervisors is also important, and to extension, complete my primary duties and additional work.

**Can you describe a typical day?**

In the mornings, I usually attend the daily meeting and prepare for the code review. The rest of the day will be devoted reading articles relating to my field of work and discussing the code with my colleagues. Also, write down the documentation and present the findings describing the code implementation.

**What is the most rewarding aspect of your current role or your greatest achievement so far?**

I would say, it can be really satisfying to get a challenging piece of code to work or to fix an extremely hard problem. Even if speech processing isn't my area of expertise, I still work hard to complete the project. This is probably the reason why I am willing to insert my passion here.

**Are there any challenging aspects? If so what are they?**

Working in a completely different academic field is quite difficult for me, and I am constantly overwhelmed. Furthermore, it's quite normal for me that I spent a few weeks on something and I'm thoroughly stuck. Sometimes I might wonder, do I need to reformulate the question differently, or am I merely barking up the wrong tree? At this moment, I appear to be stressed out.

I remember there’s one time my project was stuck for like 2 months. I’m really sure and confident that my approach could work. Anyhow, the accuracy of the models are always lower than 1%. I tried different methods and yet it didn’t work out. Apart from that, I fished for ideas with relevant researchers and discussed with them. Their suggestions were not directly related to the problem though, it still gave me different angle to it. After exploring from several aspects and gaining new perspective, I finally conquered the challenge. Taking a break is another way to give me some time to think of, and clear my head to get rid of the poor thinking definitely helped.

**What skills/qualifications from your degree or other training do you make use of in your job?**

The skills I gained from my degree mainly includes an eclectic mix of tickling challenges and taking in a new culture. For me, studying in Sheffield is an experience unlike any other. First, problem solving is the essence of what researchers exist to do. The goal for me is to minimise the occurrence of problems. Second, as a international student, I am fascinated by the distinct cultural perspectives in Sheffield. When I study here, I am exposed to traditions and social atmospheres. In a nutshell, I have the opportunity to witness a completely new way of life.

**Why did you choose to study at Sheffield?**

The University of Sheffield, which prides itself on its prowess in the natural language processing field, has become my unwavering choice for overseas studies. Possessing a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics degree is simply inadequate to become proficient in natural language processing. Therefore, I desire to learn more about machine learning upon a postgraduate degree course, and as the field of computer science focuses on the study of natural language processing, a degree in the discipline will allow me to pursue a variety of careers.

**Did your time at Sheffield meet your expectations?**

Over my time in the "Steel City", the University of Sheffield didn't deliver face-to-face teaching. It's somehow disappointing in some respect. However, it's the best moment for me to get out of my comfort zone and explore new things I never imagined.

**What were the best things about studying in the Department?**

The modules were diverse, and I have the option to learn about a wide range of computer science topics. Studying in the Department of Computer Science is a riveting experience. Technical skills such as programming, and non-technical skills such as problem-solving and leadership, are amongst some of the things I gain. Since we live in a time when technology plays such a significant part in so many aspects of life, the many skills that this degree provides are in high demand.

**What did you like best about Sheffield? (both the University and the City)**

The people for sure! It influences me more than I can ever imagine. It's a cliché, but when you ask people what they like about Sheffield, they all reply the same thing. For example, I join the National Volleyball League in Sheffield as a foreign player, yet I don't feel out of place. I can easily fit in with my teammates and we can get along swimmingly.

**Where do you see yourself in the future?**

For the time being, I intend to pursue a PhD in the near future. It is a striking fact that I really enjoy working in a research environment. I can have the opportunity to collaborate with many PhD students, faculty in academia and researchers in both industry and academic. Moreover, I could work on fishing cool ideas when conducting research.

**If you could give one piece of advice to current students or recent graduates what would it be?**

Current students should appreciate, embrace, and make the most of their time at the University of Sheffield. As for recent graduates, just remember four words: be positive, principled, pro-active, and productive. Keep moving forward, learn from everything, and prepare for the future.
